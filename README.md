# Finding Number
![feature-img](https://i.ibb.co/52nGyXH/feature.png)
I used to play this game with my sister in my childhood. It's a simple game, you just need a pencil and a paper to play. Firstly, you write random n numbers (usually 100) at random positions on the paper. And then, you will try to find the number in ascending order quickly as you can. It is the way to be a winner.

Since I joined game industry, it was my first game, I made it with Cocos2dx, which had very simple art and UI/UX. When I started learning Unity, I decided to write this game once again. It's maybe an upgrade version with better graphics. 

## Gameplay
We have 3 different modes for this game with hint option in case you can not find the next number. You can choose how many numbers you want to play from 10 to 99.
* <60 numbers: 1 hint
* <90 numbers: 2 hints
* 90-99 numbers: 3 hints

### Single player
#### Normal Single player
Player have to find all numbers without time limit to win the game. If you want to get the highest score, you must get the lowest time.
#### Time Blitz
Starting with the limited time. Every time find one number, you will be added a little time. For instance, at 99 numbers level, starting time is 30s and reward time is 10s. The left time is your score. The highest score is the highest left time.
### Two players 
Only come with mobile version. The similar rule with Normal Single player. 

Control:
* Player 1: 1 tap on the screen
* Player 2: 2 tap on the screen
